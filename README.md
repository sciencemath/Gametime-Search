# Gametime Search Results

To run the app use:

### `npm start`

Some things to note:

Opted not to use Redux as the state management lib, for reasons being the app was pretty small and basic, would have added uneeded complexity.

Somethings that could have been added if more time (1 hour time limit):

- Typescript
- Caching
- More pixel perfect matching design (although thought wasn't necessary for this).
- More testing (type in input make sure getting results back, shema matches etc).
